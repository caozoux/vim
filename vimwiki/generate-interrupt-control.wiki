Private Peripheral Interrupt (PPI)
	This is a peripheral interrupt that is specific to a single processor.
Shared Peripheral Interrupt (SPI)
	This is a peripheral interrupt that the Distributor can route to any of a specified
combination of processors.

Each peripheral interrupt is either:

Edge-triggered
	This is an interrupt that is asserted on detection of a rising edge of an interrupt
signal and then, regardless of the state of the signal, remains asserted until it is
cleared by the conditions defined by this specification.

Level-sensitive
	This is an interrupt that is asserted whenever the interrupt signal level is active,
and deasserted whenever the level is not active


Software-generated interrupt (SGI)
	This is an interrupt generated by software writing to a GICD_SGIR register in the GIC. The
system uses SGIs for interprocessor communication.

1.4.3 Models for handling interrupts
	1-N model
	N-N model 
		All processors receive the interrupt independently. When a processor acknowledges the interrupt,
		the interrupt pending state is cleared only for that processor. The interrupt remains pending for the
		other processors.
		

1.4.4 Spurious interrupts
	—
	software changes the priority of the interrupt
	—
	software disables the interrupt
	—
	software changes the processor that the interrupt targets
