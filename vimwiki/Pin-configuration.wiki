 270 Since some controllers have special logic for handling entire groups of pins
 271 they can exploit the special whole-group pin control function. The
 272 pin_config_group_set() callback is allowed to return the error code -EAGAIN,
 273 for groups it does not want to handle, or if it just wants to do some
 274 group-level handling and then fall through to iterate over all pins, in which
 275 case each individual pin will be treated by separate pin_config_set() calls as
 276 well.
